# work-time-log
This is a command line utility I created to help me track my hours at work for peace of mind.

I run this as a script on Termux (https://termux.com/) on Android. This makes it a one click button to log my in and out. I will update this readme with instructions on how to set it up.

## Running this script
Install pandas and then run `python timelog.py`.

## Running on termux
Copy this repository to termux home folder and then add a bash script into ~/.shortcuts. Also install the termux widget app, and then on the home screen, add the termux widget which will ask which script to run. Tap on the bash script you added and this will create a button on your home screen to run this. Just make sure you tap this every time you go in and come out of office.
